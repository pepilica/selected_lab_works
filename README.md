# Selected lab works

This repo contains some of the most significant lab works during my Bachelor. These works are aimed at using statistics, machine learning and numerical linear algebra for solving kind of real tasks.

- boosting - boosting implementation and some manipulations with it
- conf_intervals_hypot_checking - building confidence intervals using bootstrap + basic hypothesis checking on real data
- eigenvalues_eigenvectors_iterational_finder - self-made iterative algorithm for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix, applicated in graph partitioning 
- linear_systems_iterative_solver - several self-made iterative algorithms for solving linear systems with optimal updating, applied in voltage calculation of microscheme
- linear_regression_statistics - linear regression from the econometric and statistical point of view: conducting hypothesis tests on model, building confidence intervals, finding best model using AIC criteria
- linear_regression_ml - linear regression as machine learning instruments: exploriatory data analysis, feature engineering and selection, measuring model quality, regularization
- SVD_decomposition (with r_pca) - using SVD decomposition for background extraction of video, implemented randomized SVD decomposition (effective for hi-res videos) and applied robust PCA for this task
